Since then, other browsers have introduced it, even if their MIME sniffing algorithms were less aggressive.

This can cause HTML web pages to be downloaded instead of being rendered when they are served with a MIME type other than text/html. Make sure to set both headers correctly.

Certificate Transparency (CT) aims to prevent the use of misissued certificates for that site from going unnoticed.

See the Chrome Platform Status update. CT requirements can be satisfied via any one of the following mechanisms: Note: When a site enables the Expect-CT header, they are requesting that the browser check that any certificate for that site appears in public CT logs. Note: Browsers ignore the Expect-CT header over HTTP; the header only has effect on HTTPS connections. Note: The Expect-CT is mostly obsolete since June 2021. Since May 2018, all new TLS certificates are expected to support SCTs by default. Certificates issued before March 2018 were allowed to have a lifetime of 39 months, so they had expired in June 2021.

The Width device client hint request header field indicates the desired resource width in physical pixels — the intrinsic size of an image. The provided pixel value is a number rounded to the smallest following integer (i.e. ceiling value). The hint is particularly useful because it allows the client to request a resource that is optimal for both the screen and the layout: taking into account both the density-corrected width of the screen and the image's extrinsic size within the layout. If the desired resource width is not known at the time of the request or the resource does not have a display width, the Width header field can be omitted. If the Width header appears more than once in a message the last occurrence is used. Note:","note":"Note: Client Hints are accessible only on secure origins (via TLS). A server has to opt in to receive the Width header from the client, by sending the Accept-CH response header.
